  <title>Running Logs with RDAirPlay</title>
  <section>
    <title>Overview</title>
    <para>RDAirPlay is the Rivendell module used to run logs generated by the RDLogEdit or RDLogManager (for an overview of Rivendell logs, see Chapter Four).  It contains a wide array of features for enabling playout of audio content in live assist as well as fully automated environments.</para>

    <title>Log Machines</title>
    <para>Fundamental to the operation of RDAirPlay is the concept of a log machine.  A log machine is a virtual “device” into which a Rivendell log may be loaded and executed.  RDAirPlay has three such log machines, called Main Log, Aux 1 Log and Aux 2 Log.  Each of these log machines is completely independent of the others in the sense that different logs can be loaded and executed simultaneously in the respective machines.</para>

    <title>Layout</title>
    <para>As shown in Illustration 24, the RDAirPlay main screen consists of four primary areas:  the top area, which contains a variety of indicators for use in live assist situations as well as a set of audio meters; the button widget, which occupies the bulk of the left-hand side of the screen; the right-hand side, which displays either a SoundPanel array or a full log width; and the edit buttons in the lower left-hand corner of the screen.</para>
    <para>The top area contains the following indicators:</para>
    <section>
      <title>The Wall Clock</title>
      <para>In the upper left-hand corner is wall clock indicator, which indicates the current system date and time.  The style used for displaying times throughout RDAirPlay can be toggled between 24 hour “military” format and the traditional “AM/PM” presentation by clicking once on this display.  If the system administrator has enabled it, this display will also flash RED to indicate possible clock inaccuracy due to loss of master clock synchronization.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>The Post Point Counter</title>
      <para>Immediately to the right of the wall clock is the Post Point Counter.  A post point is an attribute applied to a log event with a hard time type.  The post point counter uses this information to display countdown and timing information.</para>
      <para>The counter can be in one of four possible states:  Idle, On Time, Under Time or Over Time.  If the next upcoming hard timed event does not have its post point attribute set, then the counter will be in Idle mode (see Illustration 26).  If the attribute is set however, then the counter will provide an estimate of how “on-time” the log currently is, on the basis of the current time and events still scheduled to be played.</para>
      <para>If the playout is such that the post point will be reached within one second of its programmed time, then the counter will be in On Time mode (see Illustration 27).  The value shown in the square brackets is the scheduled time of the point point.</para>
      <para>If the playout is such that the post point will be reached one second or more before its programmed time, then the counter will be in Early mode (see Illustration 28).  It will also give an indication of how much more material would need to be added to make the join on time.</para>
      <para>If the playout is such that the post point will be reached one second or more after its programmed time, then the counter will be in Late mode (see Illustration 29).  It will also give an indication of how much material would need to be removed to make the join on time.</para>

    <section>
      <title>The Audio Meter</title>
      <para>Immediately beneath the wall clock and post point counter is the audio meter.  The meter shows the current peak levels of audio being played out of RDAirPlay, with '0' level referenced to -16 dBFS.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>The Pie Wedge Widget</title>
      <para>In the top center of the top area is the pie wedge widget.  This widget counts down the final few seconds of each event.  The length of time it counts down, along with whether it counts to the start of the next transition or the absolute end of the event are both configurable in RDADmin.  The color of the band that grows as the countdown progresses (shown RED in Illustration 31) will change color to indicate if the currently playing event is the last event before a log stopdown.  If it is the last, it will be RED, if not, GREEN.  A BLUE band and countdown will also appear to indicate the event's talk time (if talk time markers have been set in the underlying cart).</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>The Next Stop Counter</title>
      <para>Immediately to the right of the pie wedge widget is the next stop counter.  The large numerals indicate the predicted interval of time before the next stopdown of the Main Log machine, with the actual predicted time in the square brackets.  If the Main Log is already stopped, then the counter simply displays 'Stopped'.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>The Mode Indicator</title>
      <para>In the upper right-hand corner of the top area is the mode indicator, showing the current automation mode of the log machines.  Three different modes are possible:  Automatic, in which all log features, including PLAY and SEGUE transitions and hard times are fully enabled; LiveAssist, in which no automatic transitions or hard start times are executed but automatic crossfades are done between elements; and Manual, which is very similar to LiveAssist except that not even automatic crossfades are enabled (thus permitting fully manual crossfade control by means of an external console).  To change RDAirPlay to a different mode, simply touch the mode indicator until the desired mode is indicated.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>The Label Area</title>
      <para>Immediately below the next stop counter and mode indicator is the label area.  Text messages can be made to appear here (by means of RML commands) to signal the operator concerning the state of the system or need to take some kind of action.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>The Right-Hand Side</title>
      <para>Directly below the label area is the right-hand side.  The right-hand side can display either a  SoundPanel array or a full log widget for each of the three log machines, selected by clicking the appropriate button in the lower right-hand corner of the screen. </para>
      <para>(NOTE: depending upon how the system administrator has configured the system, not all of the log machine buttons may be visible on your system).</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>The Full Log Widget</title>
      <para>As the name implies, the full log widget can be used to view the contents of a log over its entire length.  To load a log, touch the Select Log button to bring up the Select Log dialog, select the desired log from the list and then touch Load.  The currently loaded log can also be saved by touching the Save or Save As buttons, or the current log unloaded by touching Unload.  See Illustration 36.</para>
      <para>Once a log is loaded, it can be started at any point by touching an event and then pressing the Play button.  Any playing event can likewise be stopped by touching in the event and then pressing the Stop button.  To cue-up an event so that it is the next to play (indicated by the event being the first with a light green background), touch the event and then press the Make Next button.  The play parameters of an event can be modified by touching the event, then pressing the Modify button, bringing up the Edit Event dialog (see Illustration 37).</para>
      <para>In addition to having the ability to modify the event's time and transition parameters, the Edit Event dialog can be used to audition the event's audio in Cue or set the start position of the audio for on-air playback (so as to allow a program to be joined “in progress”, for example).  To audition the audio, simply press the play button.  The slider can be moved to adjust where in the audio to audition from.  To set the start position, press the Start button and then position the slider where you wish the start to be.  The red line on progress display indicates the current start position.  Pressing the Start button again returns the dialog to Audition mode.</para>
      <para>When running a log, it is often desirable to have the currently playing event always in sight.  To do this, toggle the Scroll button on (blue background).</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>The Button Log Widget</title>
      <para>To the left of the full log widget is the button log widget, consisting of a column of seven large buttons adjacent to cart labels.  This widget provides another, specialized “view” of the Main Log log machine.  Specifically, the first seven currently playing and/or next events in that log machine will always be visible here.  Events visible in the button log will be shown in the full log widget as having a green background.  Unlike the full log widget, the button log is always visible, regardless of which display has been selected for the right-hand side.</para>
      <para>To start an event from the button log, simply touch an event's corresponding Start button.  Touching the button of a running event will either (depending upon how the system administrator has configured RDAirPlay) stop or pause it.  To modify an event's parameters (via the Edit Event dialog), simply double-click the event's cart label.</para>
    </section>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Editing a Log</title>
    <para>It is possible to edit the log loaded into any of the three log log machines by means of the log edit buttons in the lower left-hand corner of the screen.</para>
    <section>
      <title>Adding an Event</title>
      <para>To add an event, touch the ADD button to open the Select Cart dialog, pick the desired cart and then touch OK.  To place the selected cart using the button log widget, simply touch one of the yellow WHERE? buttons.  To place it using the full log widget, click the event where you wish it to go and then touch the yellow WHERE? button.  If, after selecting a cart from the Select Cart dialog, you decide you don't want to add it after all, simply touch the ADD button again to cancel the operation (see Illustration 39).</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Deleting an Event</title>
      <para>To delete an event, touch the DEL button, then touch one of the violet DELETE buttons in the button log widget, or select an event and then touch the violet DELETE button.  To cancel the operation, simply touch the DEL button again (see Illustration 40).</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Moving an Event</title>
      <para>To move an event, touch the Move button, then touch one of the violet MOVE buttons in the button log widget, or select an event and then touch the violet MOVE button, then touch one of the yellow TO buttons in the button log widget, or select an event and then touch the yellow TO button.  To cancel the operation at any stage, simply touch the MOVE button again.  It is perfectly permissible to move an event between two different log machines.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Copying an Event</title>
      <para>To copy an event, touch the Copy button, then touch one of the violet COPY buttons in the button log widget, or select an event and then touch the violet COPY button, then touch one of the yellow TO buttons in the button log widget, or select an event and then touch the yellow TO button.  To cancel the operation at any stage, simply touch the COPY button again.  It is perfectly permissible to copy an event between two different log machines.</para>
    </section>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>The SoundPanel</title>
    <para>The SoundPanel is an array of buttons that appears in the right-hand side of RDAirPlay when the Sound Panel button is selected (see Illustration 41).  Each button can be associated with a particular cart in the Library (either Audio or Macro carts), which is then played each time the button is clicked.  The soundpanel is particularly useful in live assist situations where it is desired to drop in some piece of audio on a live, improvised basis.</para>
    <section>
      <title>Panel Types</title>
      <para>The SoundPanel has multiple panels or “panes” that can scrolled through by touching the double-left or double-right arrow buttons.  Each panel has a designator, (displayed just to the right of the arrow keys), consisting of the letter 'U' or 'S' followed by a number.  An 'S' indicates that the panel is a 'system' panel, meaning that its button assignments will show up in all RDAirPlay instances across a given site; while a 'U' indicates a 'user' panel, one which is associated with a particular user and that will “follow around” that user where ever he logs in in the site.  (Depending upon how the system administrator has configured RDAirPlay, you may not have both of these panel types available to you).</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Programming a SoundPanel Button</title>
      <para>To associate a cart with a panel button, first touch the Setup button, which will begin to flash.  (Depending upon how the system administrator has configured RDAirPlay, the Setup button may be disabled).  Next, touch the button you wish to program, opening the Edit Button dialog (see Illustration 41).</para>
      <para>Touch the Set Cart button to open the Select Cart dialog and pick a cart.  To clear the button –i.e. have no cart associated with it – touch the Clear button.  To assign a custom background color to the button, touch the Set Color button.  A custom label can be entered in the Label field, or the name of the cart will be used by default.  Touch the OK button when done.  When done programming all the desired buttons, touch the Setup button again to toggle off Setup mode.</para>
