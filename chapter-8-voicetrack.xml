    <title>Voicetracking in Rivendell</title>
    <para>Voicetracking is a capability wherein custom “one-off” content is created and inserted into logs, making it possible to create programming that sounds very spontaneous and “live”.  In Rivendell, such voicetracks are placed into a special type of audio cart known as a voicetrack cart.  These carts are automatically created, deleted and managed by the voicetracker interface (part of the RDLogEdit module), with no manual user intervention required.  The voicetracker module also includes extensive capabilities for allowing customization of the transitions between log elements.</para>
    <section>
      <title>Prerequisites</title>
      <para>Before beginning voicetracking for a particular service, a voicetracker group and pool of available cart numbers must be configured in the RDAdmin module.  These procedures are detailed in the Rivendell Technical and Administration Guide.</para>

      <title>VoiceTrack Markers</title>
      <para>A voicetrack marker is a meta event that can be inserted into a log as a “placeholder” to others to indicate where a voicetrack is to be recorded.  Track markers can be inserted by RDLogEdit, RDLogManager events or even “embedded” in data generated by external schedulers such as RCS SelectorTM.</para>

    <title>Using the Voicetrack Interface</title>
    <section>
      <title>The VoiceTracker Dialog</title>
      <para>To voicetrack a log, start the RDLogEdit module (see Illustration 19), highlight the desired log and touch the VoiceTracker button, opening the VoiceTracker dialog (see Illustration 59).  This dialog consists of three major parts:  the waveform area, the log list and the control buttons.</para>
      <para>The waveform area is in the upper center part of the dialog, and consists of four “panes”.  The upper three display waveform depictions while the fourth contains audition control buttons, an audio meter and various counters.  Directly below this is the log list, showing a copy of the currently loaded log.  The control buttons occupy the bottom and right-hand edges of the dialog.</para>

      <title>Editing Transitions</title>
      <para>When an event is selected in the log list, a graphical depiction of the transition into that event is loaded into the waveform area.  If the selected event and its prior event in the log is not a voicetrack or track marker, then the selected event will be displayed in the third pane of the waveform area and the previous event displayed in the first pane.  If the selected event or its prior event is a voicetrack or track marker, then voicetrack or marker will be displayed in the second pane of the waveform area.</para>
      <para>Once selected, a transition can be auditioned by touching the play button in the fourth pane of the waveform area.  Play will start from the left-hand edge of the topmost waveform.  This start location can be adjusted by dragging the topmost waveform to the left or right by means of the mouse or touchscreen.  If the transition type of the selected event is SEGUE, it is also possible to adjust the degree of audio overlap by dragging the second or third waveform as well.  It's possible to “undo” changes made in the segue overlap by right-clicking on the waveform and selecting Undo Segue Changes from the menu.  To make the overlap permanent, touch the Save button.  To restore the transition to its default state (calculated on the basis of segue markers from the Library) touch the Do Over  button.  The transition type can be changed by right-clicking on an event and selecting the desired transition type from the menu.</para>

      <title>Inserting and Deleting Track Markers</title>
      <para>It is possible to insert a new voicetrack marker by selecting the desired location in the log list and touching the Insert Track button.  An existing voicetrack marker can likewise by deleted by selecting it in the log list and touching the Delete Track button.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Moving Between Track Markers</title>
      <para>It is possible to move directly to the next or previous voicetrack marker simply by touching the Next Track or Previous Track buttons, respectively.</para>
    </section>

      <title>Recording a Voicetrack</title>
      <para>Once the desired voicetrack marker has been selected, the process of recording a voicetrack consists of four steps, each initiated by one of the four square control buttons in the upper right-hand corner of the dialog.  (See Illustration 50).</para>
      <para>To begin, touch the topmost Start button.  This will cause the audio in the topmost pane to begin playing, with a cursor to show playback position (see Illustration 61).  To begin the actual recording, touch the Record button (see Illustration 62).  To start the following event (in the third pane), touch the second Start button (see Illustration 63).  Finally, to stop recording, touch the Save button (see Illustration 64).  The record process can be canceled at any time by touching the Abort button, restoring the transition to its default</para>
      <para>state.  It is also possible to undo a completed voicetrack by touching the Do Over button.</para>
      <para>Once completed, the segue overlaps into and out of a voicetrack can be adjusted in the same manner as for simple transitions –i.e. by dragging the appropriate waveforms with the mouse.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Adjusting Transition Levels</title>
      <para>It is possible to adjust the audio fade levels applied during transitions by means of rubber bands on the waveform displays.  These are green lines with small square targets.   To adjust a rubber band, use the mouse to grab one of the targets and drag it to the desired location.</para>

      <title>Importing Voicetracks</title>
      <para>In addition to recording in realtime, it's possible to import a voicetrack directly from an audio file.  To do so, select the desired voicetrack marker and then touch the Import button to open the Import/Export Audio dialog (see Illustration 5).  (For more information on using the Import/Export Audio dialog, see Section 3.1.0 Importing Audio from a File).  Once imported, the voicetrack can be manipulated in the same manner as those that were directly recorded.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Hitting the Post</title>
      <para>If the event following a voicetrack has its Talk Time markers set, it is possible to set the transition so that the end of the voicetrack automatically aligns with the end of the Talk Time (commonly referred to as hitting the post).  To do this, simply touch the Hit Post button.</para>
